# Chapter 21: VM Beyond Physical - Policy 

## HOMEWORK (Simulation)
This simulator, paging-policy.py, allows you to play around with different page-replacement policies. See the README for details.

### Questions and Answers 
1. Generate random addresses with the following arguments: -s 0 -n 10, -s 1 -n 10, and -s 2 -n 10. Change the policy from FIFO, to LRU, to OPT. Compute whether each access in said address traces are hits or misses.
```sh
./paging-policy.py -s 0 -n 10 -p FIFO -c => Hit rate = 10% 
./paging-policy.py -s 1 -n 10 -p FIFO -c => 20% 
./paging-policy.py -s 2 -n 10 -p FIFO -c => 40% 

./paging-policy.py -s 0 -n 10 -p LRU -c => 20% 
./paging-policy.py -s 1 -n 10 -p LRU -c => 20% 
./paging-policy.py -s 2 -n 10 -p LRU -c => 40% 

./paging-policy.py -s 0 -n 10 -p OPT -c => 40% 
./paging-policy.py -s 1 -n 10 -p OPT -c => 30% 
./paging-policy.py -s 2 -n 10 -p OPT -c => 40% 
```
2. For a cache of size 5, generate worst-case address reference streams for each of the following policies: FIFO, LRU, and MRU (worst-case reference streams cause the most misses possible. For the worst case reference streams, how much bigger of a cache is needed to improve performance dramatically and approach OPT?
```sh
./paging-policy.py --addresses=0,1,2,3,4,5,0,1,2,3,4,5 --policy=FIFO --cachesize=5 -c
./paging-policy.py --addresses=0,1,2,3,4,5,0,1,2,3,4,5 --policy=LRU --cachesize=5 -c
./paging-policy.py --addresses=0,1,2,3,4,5,4,5,4,5,4,5 --policy=MRU --cachesize=5 -c

=> Just one is enough, cachesize = 6. 
```

3. Generate a random trace (use python or perl). How would you expect the different policies to perform on such a trace?
```sh
Just like question 1. 
```

4. Now generate a trace with some locality. How can you generate such a trace? How does LRU perform on it? How much better than RAND is LRU? How does CLOCK do? How about CLOCK with
different numbers of clock bits?
```sh
Locality: [3, 1, 4, 0, 2, 1, 9, 5, 0]
./paging-policy.py -a 3,1,4,0,2,1,9,5,0 -p FIFO -c 
FINALSTATS hits 0   misses 9   hitrate 0.00

./paging-policy.py -a 3,1,4,0,2,1,9,5,0 -p LRU -c 
FINALSTATS hits 0   misses 9   hitrate 0.00

./paging-policy.py -a 3,1,4,0,2,1,9,5,0 -p RAND -c 
FINALSTATS hits 1   misses 8   hitrate 11.11

./paging-policy.py -a 3,1,4,0,2,1,9,5,0 -p RAND -c -b 1
./paging-policy.py -a 3,1,4,0,2,1,9,5,0 -p RAND -c -b 2
./paging-policy.py -a 3,1,4,0,2,1,9,5,0 -p RAND -c -b 2
```

5. Use a program like valgrind to instrument a real application and
generate a virtual page reference stream. For example, running
valgrind --tool=lackey --trace-mem=yes ls will output
a nearly-complete reference trace of every instruction and data reference made by the program ls. To make this useful for the simulator above, youâ€™ll have to first transform each virtual memory
reference into a virtual page-number reference (done by masking
off the offset and shifting the resulting bits downward). How big
of a cache is needed for your application trace in order to satisfy a
large fraction of requests? Plot a graph of its working set as the size
of the cache increases.
```sh
Do later... I hope so... 
```
