# Homework(Simulation)
## This section introduces ffs.py, a simple FFS simulator you can use to understand better how FFS-based file and directory allocation work. 
### Questions
1. Examine the file in.largefile, and then run the simulator with flag-f
in.largefile and-L 4. The latter sets the large-file exception to 4 blocks.
What will the resulting allocation look like? Run with-c to check.
```
It allocates for all group (total 10) in block data, each have 4 blocks, total will be 40. 
```

2. Now run with -L 30. What do you expect to see? Once again, turn on -c
to see if you were right. You can also use -S to see exactly which blocks
were allocated to the file /a.
```
It allocates 29 block data in group 0 (root), then expand to the 2nd group with another 11 block data. 
```
3. Now we will compute some statistics about the file. The first is something
we call file span, which is the max distance between any two data blocks of
the file or between the inode and any data block. Calculate the filespan of
/a. 
    
    Run ffs.py -f in.largefile -L 4 -T -c to see what it is. Do
    the same with -L 100. What difference do you expect in file span as the
    large-file exception parameter changes from low values to high values?
```
The file span decreases. (from 372 to 59 for files, and 373 to 60 for directories)
```
4. Now letâ€™s look at a new input file, in.manyfiles. How do you think the
FFS policy will lay these files out across groups? (you can run with -v to
see what files and directories are created, or just cat in.manyfiles). Run
the simulator with-c to see if you were right.
```
Dir j allocates in group 1
Dir t allocates in group 2

And the rest file will allocate according to the group e.g., l, m, n, o, p, q, r, C allocates in group 1 following dir j. 

The same goes for u, v, w, x, y, z, A, B
```
5. A metric to evaluate FFS is called dir span. This metric calculates the spread
of files within a particular directory, specifically the max distance between
the inodes and data blocks of all files in the directory and the inode and data
block of the directory itself. Run with in.manyfiles and the-T flag, and
calculate the dir span of the three directories. Run with-c to check. How
good of a job does FFS do in minimizing dir span?
```
Will come back later 
```

6. Now change the size of the inode table per group to 5 (-i 5). How do you
think this will change the layout of the files? Run with -c to see if you were
right. How does it affect the dir span?
```
Same with #5 
```
7. Which group should FFS place inode of a new directory in? The default
(simulator) policy looks for the group with the most free inodes. A different
policy looks for a set of groups with the most free inodes. For example, if
you run with -A 2,when allocating a new directory, the simulator will look
at groups in pairs and pick the best pair for the allocation. Run ./ffs.py-f in.manyfiles -i 5 -A 2 -c to see how allocation changes with
this strategy. How does it affect dir span? Why might this policy be good?
```
Same with #6. 
```
8. One last policy change we will explore relates to file fragmentation. Run
./ffs.py-f in.fragmented-v and see if you can predict how the
files that remain are allocated. Run with-c to confirm your answer. What
is interesting about the data layout of file /i? Why is it problematic?
```
file /i become fragemented, and it allocate following by each data for each data block a,c,e,g being deleted. 
```
9. A new policy, which we call contiguous allocation (-C), tries to ensure that
each file is allocated contiguously. Specifically, with-C n, the file system
tries to ensure that n contiguous blocks are free within a group before al
locating a block. Run ./ffs.py-f in.fragmented-v-C 2-c to
see the difference. How does layout change as the parameter passed to-C
increases? Finally, how does-C affect filespan and dirspan?
```
span: files
  file:         /b  filespan:  10
  file:         /d  filespan:  10
  file:         /f  filespan:  10
  file:         /h  filespan:  10
  file:         /i  filespan:  25
               avg  filespan:  13.00

span: directories
  dir:           /  dirspan:  26
               avg  dirspan:  26.00

```
